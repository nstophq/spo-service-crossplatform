## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-05

Stabilisation release ahead of 1.0. Fixes the `0.2.0` package's corrupted
dependency floor, hardens the pre-authentication boundary (admin URL shape,
deterministic vendor selection, reflected-API probe), and makes the URL-only
quick start actually start interactive sign-in. Published first as `0.3.0-rc1`
and `0.3.0-rc2` for manual verification on macOS and Linux; rc2 fixes the two
findings from the rc1 matrix (Ctrl+C during browser sign-in, vendor floor).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform -Url <admin-url>` with no
  other parameters now starts interactive system-browser sign-in, matching
  the native `Connect-SPOService` and the README quick start. Previously the
  URL-only call bound to the certificate parameter set and prompted for
  `ClientId`, `TenantId` and `CertificatePath`. `-UseSystemBrowser` still
  works and is now optional. Certificate and `.env` flows are unchanged and
  still select their parameter sets deterministically; combinations that mix
  sets fail at parameter binding. Unattended scripts must pass certificate
  parameters explicitly. To fail fast instead of hanging on a browser that
  cannot open, interactive sign-in is refused up front over SSH without a
  forwarded display, on Linux with no `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, and in
  Azure Cloud Shell, with a message pointing at certificate auth.

### Security

- Admin URL validation now accepts only canonical commercial-cloud hosts of
  the exact form `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com`. Previously the host
  check allowed arbitrary suffixes after `.sharepoint.com`, so a URL such as
  `https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com.attacker.example` passed validation
  and reached the sign-in request. Non-default ports, user-info, paths, query
  strings, fragments, punycode labels and sovereign-cloud domains are rejected,
  and the check now runs before the vendor module loads. Sovereign clouds
  (`sharepoint.us`, `.de`, `.cn`) are unsupported until an authority mapping
  exists; this is a validation fix, not a confirmed token-exfiltration path.

### Fixed

- Vendor module selection is deterministic. `Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform`
  reuses an already-loaded `Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` if it
  meets the manifest minimum, otherwise imports the
  highest installed version that does, and refuses clearly when the only
  loaded or installed versions are older (a loaded vendor assembly cannot be
  swapped; the fix is a new session or `Update-Module`). Previously the first
  module returned by `Get-Module` was used without ordering or a version check.
- Every non-public vendor member the connect path relies on (constructors,
  sign-in methods, settable properties) is now probed before authentication
  or any global state change. A vendor build that changed its internals fails
  with one error listing the missing members, vendor version and path, and
  PowerShell/runtime/OS/architecture, with a link to the issue tracker and no
  tenant data. `Disconnect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform` no longer depends on
  module list order and stays idempotent.
- `-ClientTag` is capped at 13 characters at parameter binding. The vendor
  prepends its own `TAPS (<version>)` tag and CSOM limits the combined value
  to 32 characters, so longer tags failed inside the vendor constructor with
  an opaque out-of-range error on every tested build.
- A failed connection leaves any existing connection untouched and disposes
  the partially built vendor context. `SPOService.CurrentService` is only
  assigned after the admin-site check succeeds; the original error surfaces
  unchanged.
- Ctrl+C during interactive sign-in now returns the prompt within about a
  quarter second. The vendor's `OAuthSession.SignIn` is async in name only: it
  blocks its calling thread until sign-in completes or its 90-second timer
  fires, so the previous poll loop never ran and Ctrl+C was ignored until the
  vendor gave up (found in `0.3.0-rc1` manual testing). The module now invokes
  sign-in on a background thread via the shim's `BackgroundInvoker` and polls
  it. The vendor thread and loopback listener still run until the vendor's
  timeout because its API exposes no cancellation token.
- `.env` handling is pinned by tests as opt-in and literal: only the explicit
  `-EnvPath` (default `./.env`) is read, with no variable, tilde or shell
  expansion of values.
- The minimum `Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` version is raised from
  `16.0.23408.12000` to `16.0.26615.12013`. Manual `0.3.0-rc1` testing against
  the old floor showed it lacks the certificate `OAuthSession` constructor and
  `SignInWithCert`, so certificate auth could never have worked there; the
  vendor contract probe refused it cleanly before authentication. Every
  Gallery build from `16.0.26615.12013` through `16.0.27612.12000` was probed
  and passes the full member contract; `16.0.26510.12000` and earlier do not.
- Release staging now copies the manifest unchanged, preserving the SPO
  dependency floor. The `0.2.0` Gallery package incorrectly declared `0.2.0`
  as its dependency minimum because the release workflow replaced both
  `ModuleVersion` assignments.
- Tags must match committed version and prerelease metadata before builds
  or publishing approval. Changelog notes are passed directly to publishing,
  avoiding manifest quoting problems. Failed staging cleans up its output.
- Removed identifying certificate fields and captured tenant properties from
  investigation notes; added source-only privacy checks for pull requests.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-22

Drops the hand-rolled MSAL token closure in favour of the vendor module's
own `OAuthSession`, and adds native interactive auth on macOS/Linux. The
module now only replaces the broken CSOM transport — authentication goes
through the official code path, which is what made interactive auth
reachable in the first place. Runtime floor raised to PowerShell 7.6 /
.NET 10.

### Added

- `-UseSystemBrowser` parameter set on `Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform`
  for interactive auth via the OS default browser. Calls the reflected
  `OAuthSession(authority, useSystemBrowser:$true)` ctor + `SignIn` and
  polls the returned `Task` so Ctrl+C escapes promptly. Embedded-webview
  interactive auth is intentionally still not supported.
- `Private/Assert-SupportedRuntime.ps1` — runtime floor guard called from
  both `psm1` import and the top of `Connect-*`, belt-and-braces with the
  manifest's `PowerShellVersion = '7.6'` so non-7.6 hosts fail fast with
  an actionable message instead of a late reflection error.
- `tests/ModuleContract.Tests.ps1` covering `Assert-SupportedRuntime`
  behaviour and the `Connect-*` parameter-set / shape contract (including
  the new `SystemBrowser` set), wired into build and release smoke jobs.
- `docs/investigation/04-native-session-and-interactive-auth.md` plus a
  smoke artifact, preserving the reasoning for the auth rework alongside
  the existing investigation trail.

### Changed

- Raised the supported runtime floor to `PowerShell 7.6 / .NET 10`.
  Previous `7.4 / net8.0` target is dropped; 0.2.0 will not import on
  7.4/7.5 hosts.
- Retargeted the native shim and packaged DLL layout from `net8.0` to
  `net10.0` to match the new floor. PSGallery layout now ships the shim
  under `bin/net10.0/`.
- Certificate-based auth now runs through the reflected native
  `OAuthSession` ctor + `SignInWithCert()` and is attached to
  `CmdLetContext.OAuthSession`. Token refresh/caching is handled by the
  native session instead of an MSAL cache we owned.
- Moved the authenticated `SPOServiceHelper.IsTenantAdminSite` check to
  **after** `OAuthSession` attachment. Pre-auth validation is now purely
  syntactic (`Test-SPOAdminUrlFormat`); the tenant-admin CSOM check still
  runs before `SPOService.CurrentService` is mutated, so non-admin URLs
  still fail without disturbing any prior connection.
- Hardened the `pwsh 7.6` installer action with SHA256 verification of
  the downloaded archive so CI cannot be silently poisoned by a bad
  mirror.
- Kept the native `HttpClientExecutor` shim as the sole transport repair
  layer — same GET→POST upgrade, `NonClosingStream` wrapping, and static
  `HttpClient` reuse as 0.1.0.

### Removed

- Custom MSAL `ConfidentialClientApplication` setup and the
  `ExecutingWebRequest` bearer-injection closure that 0.1.0 used to
  stitch tokens onto each CSOM call. The native `OAuthSession` does both
  jobs, and keeping our own token plumbing duplicated logic the vendor
  module already ships.
- `$script:TokenProvider` cache and the corresponding teardown in
  `Disconnect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform`. Disconnect now only clears
  `SPOService.CurrentService`; the native session owns its own lifetime.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-21

Initial release. Scope: PowerShell 7.4+ on macOS/Linux, certificate-based
app-only auth only.

### Added

- `Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform` function — cross-platform replacement
  for `Connect-SPOService` on PowerShell 7 / .NET 8 on macOS and Linux.
  Works around two defects in `Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` so
  the official SPO cmdlets run unmodified on the repaired CSOM pipeline.
- `Disconnect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform` function — clears
  `SPOService.CurrentService` and drops the cached token provider.
- `Connect-SPOService` and `Disconnect-SPOService` aliases — drop-in names
  matching the broken native cmdlets, so existing Windows-authored scripts
  work unchanged after importing this module.
- Native `SPOService.CrossPlatform.dll` shim (`HttpClientExecutor`,
  `HttpClientExecutorFactory`) replacing the SPO runtime's broken
  `HttpWebRequestExecutor` with an `HttpClient`-based executor.
- Certificate-based auth via MSAL `ConfidentialClientApplication` with
  automatic token refresh through MSAL's cache.
- Three parameter sets for credentials: explicit `CertificatePath`,
  preloaded `Certificate`, and convenience `.env` file loading.
- Import-time Windows rejection: the module refuses to load on Windows
  with a terminating error pointing users at the stock SPO module.
- Admin URL validation via
  `SPOServiceHelper.IsTenantAdminSite` before `SPOService.CurrentService`
  is mutated, so non-admin URLs (e.g. `https://contoso.sharepoint.com`)
  fail fast and leave any prior connection intact.

### Changed

- Declared `PowerShellVersion = '7.4'` in the manifest so it matches the
  `net8.0` target of the shipped shim DLL. (0.1.0 does not claim 7.2/7.3
  support; those runtimes ship .NET 6/7 and cannot load a `net8.0`
  assembly.)
- `Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform` no longer returns a diagnostic
  `pscustomobject` on success; matches the silent-success convention of
  the native `Connect-SPOService`.
- Native shim's static `HttpClient` now runs with `UseCookies = false`.
  CSOM is bearer-token authenticated and does not need cookie state; this
  also prevents the process-wide client from accumulating cross-session
  cookie state across reconnects.
