# Release 0.3.0 manual verification

Manual, tenant-dependent checks for `0.3.0-rc1` before promoting to `0.3.0`.
Automated CI already covers build, import, parameter binding, URL validation,
vendor-contract probing and packaging on macOS and Ubuntu; this file records
what CI cannot do: real authentication and real CSOM traffic.

**Sanitisation rule.** Record only what is listed under "Record". Never commit
tenant names, tenant or client IDs, admin URLs, certificate subjects or
thumbprints, usernames, quotas, site lists or any other tenant data. Use
`contoso` placeholders if an example is needed. The PR hygiene scan rejects
real `*.sharepoint.com` hosts and non-placeholder GUIDs, but it is a guard, not
a substitute for reading what you paste.

## Setup

Install the release candidate into the current user scope in a fresh session:

```powershell
Install-Module SPOService.CrossPlatform -AllowPrerelease -RequiredVersion 0.3.0-rc1 -Scope CurrentUser
Import-Module SPOService.CrossPlatform -Force
(Get-Module SPOService.CrossPlatform).Version          # 0.3.0
(Get-Command Connect-SPOService).ResolvedCommand.Name   # Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform
```

Collect the environment facts once per machine:

```powershell
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::OSDescription
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::OSArchitecture
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::FrameworkDescription
(Get-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -ListAvailable).Version
```

## Negative checks (no tenant needed, run first)

These take seconds and confirm the pre-auth boundary behaves on this machine.

| Check | Command | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spoofed host refused | `Connect-SPOService -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com.example` | Error names the host only (no credentials or query echoed), mentions `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com`, no browser. The vendor module shows as loaded: `RequiredModules` imports it with ours, before any of our code runs |
| Headless guard | `$env:SSH_CONNECTION='x'; Remove-Item Env:DISPLAY,Env:WAYLAND_DISPLAY -EA 0; Connect-SPOService -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com` | Error mentions interactive sign-in and `-CertificatePath`; no browser opens. Then `Remove-Item Env:SSH_CONNECTION` |
| Tag too long | `Connect-SPOService -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com -ClientTag abcdefghijklmn` | Parameter validation error, 13-character limit |

## Matrix

Fill one block per row. Use a disposable lab tenant scope; never production or
employer resources. The reversible write must be something you can undo in the
same session (for example create and remove a test org-assets library, or set
and restore a harmless tenant property).

Read-only set:

```powershell
Get-SPOTenant | Select-Object -First 1 | Out-Null
Get-SPOSite -Limit 10 | Out-Null
Get-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary | Out-Null
Get-SPOUser -Site <a site you own> | Select-Object -First 1 | Out-Null
```

### Row 1: macOS arm64, current vendor, certificate auth (required)

```powershell
Connect-SPOService -Url <admin-url> -ClientId <id> -TenantId <id> -CertificatePath <pfx> -CertificatePassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString)
```

Record:

- OS/version, architecture:
- PowerShell version:
- Runtime (FrameworkDescription):
- SPOService.CrossPlatform version: 0.3.0-rc1
- Vendor module version loaded (`(Get-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell).Version`):
- Auth flow: certificate (PFX path)
- Connect: pass / fail
- Read-only cmdlets exercised and result:
- Reversible write exercised, result, and confirmation it was undone:
- `Disconnect-SPOService` then a `Get-SPOTenant` fails as expected: pass / fail
- Sanitised error category/message, if any:

### Row 2: macOS arm64, current vendor, system browser (required)

```powershell
Connect-SPOService -Url <admin-url>
```

Also confirm: browser opens, sign-in completes, control returns to the prompt, and a second Connect in the same session works after Disconnect.

Record: same fields as Row 1, auth flow "system browser (URL-only default)".

Ctrl+C check: start a URL-only Connect, then either press Ctrl+C or close the
browser without signing in. Expected: the prompt returns within about a second
(not after the vendor's 90-second timeout), `Get-SPOTenant` fails with no
connection, and the browser tab may remain until the vendor times out. Record:
pass / fail. (`0.3.0-rc1` failed this: the prompt was blocked for the full 90 s.)

### Row 3: Ubuntu x64, current vendor, certificate auth (required)

Same command as Row 1. Record the same fields. This is the first human-run
Linux authentication for the module; note anything surprising even if it passes.

### Row 4: Ubuntu x64, current vendor, system browser (if a desktop is available)

Same as Row 2 on a Linux desktop session. If only SSH is available, record
that the headless guard refused with the expected message and mark the row
"narrowed out: no desktop".

### Row 5: declared minimum vendor 16.0.26615.12013 (required, macOS or Ubuntu)

The connect cmdlet reuses whatever vendor version is already loaded if it meets
the floor, so load the minimum explicitly in a fresh session before connecting:

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -RequiredVersion 16.0.26615.12013 -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -RequiredVersion 16.0.26615.12013
Import-Module SPOService.CrossPlatform -Force
Connect-SPOService -Url <admin-url> -ClientId <id> -TenantId <id> -CertificatePath <pfx> -CertificatePassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString)
Get-SPOTenant | Out-Null
Get-SPOSite -Limit 5 | Out-Null
```

Record: same fields as Row 1; vendor version must read 16.0.26615.12013.
Browser flow on this row is optional.

## Result

- All required rows pass: yes / no
- Defects found (link issues):
- Decision: promote to 0.3.0 / cut rc2
- Signed off by, date:

## Promotion steps (after sign-off)

1. Set `Prerelease = ''` in `SPOService.CrossPlatform.psd1`, change the CHANGELOG
   summary sentence about `0.3.0-rc1` to past tense if desired, commit and merge.
2. Tag `v0.3.0` on the merged commit and push; approve the `PSGallery Publishing`
   environment when the workflow pauses.
3. Confirm `Find-Module SPOService.CrossPlatform` shows 0.3.0 with the
   `Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell >= 16.0.26615.12013` dependency.
4. Leave 0.2.0 listed. Its dependency-floor defect is documented in the CHANGELOG.
