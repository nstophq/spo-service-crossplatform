**macOS / Linux only.** Cross-platform replacement for `Connect-SPOService`
that lets the official
[`Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell`](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell)
cmdlets run unmodified on **PowerShell 7.6 / .NET 10 on macOS and Linux**.
Importing this module on Windows fails intentionally — use the stock SPO
module there.

```powershell
Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com

Get-SPOTenant
Get-SPOSite -Limit 10
Get-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary
```

A URL-only call opens your system browser for interactive sign-in, the same
as the native cmdlet. Unattended scripts must pass certificate parameters
(see [Authentication](#authentication)); interactive sign-in refuses to start
over SSH without a display, on headless Linux, or in Azure Cloud Shell.

The module also exports a `Connect-SPOService` alias (and
`Disconnect-SPOService`) that shadow the broken native cmdlets of the same
name for the current session. Scripts written for Windows can import
`SPOService.CrossPlatform` on macOS/Linux and keep calling
`Connect-SPOService` for the supported subset: URL-only interactive
sign-in and certificate app-only auth. Native parameters outside that
subset (managed identity, credential, region and authentication-URL
flows) are not implemented; see [Authentication](#authentication).

The module's role is to get the CSOM transport working, not to vet every
cmdlet. The following have been exercised end-to-end against a real
tenant: `Get-SPOTenant`, `Get-SPOSite`, `Get-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary`,
`Get-SPOUser`, `Remove-SPOOrgAssetsLibrary`. The broader cmdlet surface
routes through the same pipeline and should work — please open an issue
if you hit a cmdlet that doesn't.

## Why this exists

The SPO Management Shell is Microsoft-supported on **Windows PowerShell 5.1
only**. Running `Connect-SPOService` on macOS fails with
`Object reference not set to an instance of an object`, and even after that
is bypassed every CSOM call fails with `Invalid request.` or
`400 Bad Request`. This module works around both defects:

1. **Null Win32 registry dereference.** `SPOServiceHelper.InstantiateSPOService`
   unconditionally calls `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.CurrentUser.OpenSubKey(...)`
   and `LocalMachine.OpenSubKey(...)`. Both properties return `null` on
   non-Windows .NET Core. The module crashes before auth even runs.

2. **Empty-body HTTP requests.** The module ships
   `Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime` 16.0.0.0, compiled against .NET
   Framework's `HttpWebRequest`. On .NET Core, `HttpWebRequestExecutor.GetRequestStream()`
   does not flush the body to the socket, so SharePoint receives
   `Content-Length: 0` and returns `Invalid request.` for every CSOM POST.

A native shim (`src/SPOService.CrossPlatform/HttpClientExecutor.cs`) replaces
the broken executor with an `HttpClient`-based one. The PowerShell entry
point (`Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform`) builds `CmdLetContext` + `SPOService`
directly via reflection to skip the null-deref path, installs the shim on
the context, and sets `SPOService.CurrentService` so the official cmdlets
pick it up transparently.

Full root-cause analysis and evidence: [`docs/investigation/`](docs/investigation/).

## Installation

### From PSGallery

```powershell
Install-Module SPOService.CrossPlatform
```

The published package includes the prebuilt shim DLL under `bin/net10.0/`.

### From source

Requires PowerShell 7.6 and the .NET 10 SDK, plus the SPO module installed (the
shim references its `Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henkas/spo-service-crossplatform.git
cd spo-service-crossplatform

# Install the official SPO module once if you don't have it
pwsh -c 'Install-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser'

# Build the native shim
dotnet build -c Release src/SPOService.CrossPlatform/SPOService.CrossPlatform.csproj

# Load the module
pwsh -c 'Import-Module ./SPOService.CrossPlatform.psd1'
```

The module auto-discovers the DLL from
`src/SPOService.CrossPlatform/bin/Release/net10.0/` or `bin/net10.0/`.

## Authentication

Authentication uses the native reflected `OAuthSession` model from the
official SPO module. On Unix, this module keeps the native auth/session
shape and only replaces the broken CSOM transport.

Supported auth flows:

### 1. Certificate-based app-only auth

```powershell
Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform `
    -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com `
    -ClientId <app-id> -TenantId <tenant-id> `
    -CertificatePath ./app.pfx `
    -CertificatePassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString 'PFX password')
```

### 2. Preloaded X509Certificate2

```powershell
$cert = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2]::new($pfxPath, $pwd)

Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform `
    -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com `
    -ClientId <app-id> -TenantId <tenant-id> `
    -Certificate $cert
```

### 3. `.env` file (opt-in convenience)

For local development. Create a `.env` next to where you run the cmdlet:

```ini
ClientId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
TenantId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
password=<pfx-password>
# Optional. Defaults to ./app.pfx
# CertificatePath=/absolute/path/to/cert.pfx
```

```powershell
Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com -UseEnvFile
```

Ensure restrictive permissions on the file (`chmod 600 .env`) and never
commit it. See [`.env.example`](.env.example). For production, prefer
`Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement` or another secret store.

### 4. Interactive system browser (default)

```powershell
Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com

# equivalent, explicit form
Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform -Url https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com -UseSystemBrowser
```

This is the default when only `-Url` is given and the only interactive mode
supported on Unix in this release. Embedded-webview interactive auth is
intentionally not supported.

Interactive sign-in needs a desktop session to open a browser in. The
cmdlet refuses up front, before any vendor code runs, when it can tell
there is none: an SSH session without a forwarded display, Linux with no
`DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, or Azure Cloud Shell. The error points at
the certificate parameters to use instead.

Ctrl+C during sign-in returns you to the prompt within about a quarter of a
second and no connection is established. The vendor's sign-in call blocks its
own thread until sign-in completes or its 90-second timer fires, so the module
runs it on a background thread and polls; after Ctrl+C that thread and its
loopback listener keep running until the vendor times out, because the vendor
API exposes no cancellation token. A stray browser tab may still show the
sign-in page. Closing the browser without signing in has the same effect: the
prompt is yours, the vendor gives up after 90 seconds.

> **Azure Cloud Shell is not supported by this flow.** `-UseSystemBrowser`
> spins up a local HTTP listener on `127.0.0.1` and opens a browser on the
> host to receive the OAuth redirect. Cloud Shell's session has no local
> browser and no way to reach the listener from outside the container, so
> the sign-in hangs until it times out. A future release may add a
> terminal-only flow (print the authorization URL, let the user open it
> in their own browser, and paste the final redirect URL back into the
> terminal) to cover this case; it is not in scope for this release.

## Disconnecting

```powershell
Disconnect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform
```

Clears `SPOService.CurrentService`.

## Compatibility

- PowerShell 7.6
- .NET 10 runtime (bundled with `pwsh` 7.6)
- macOS (tested on Darwin 25, arm64) and Linux (expected to work on the
  same runtime — please open an issue with your distro if not)
- `Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` 16.0.26615.12013 or newer (every
  Gallery build from that version through 16.0.27612.12000 has been verified
  against the module's internal-API contract; older builds lack the
  certificate sign-in members). The connect cmdlet reuses the version already
  loaded in your session if it meets this floor, otherwise imports the highest
  installed version that does, and probes the vendor internals it relies on
  before signing in. If a vendor
  update changes those internals you get one error naming the version and the
  missing members, before anything is authenticated or changed.

Windows is explicitly unsupported: importing this module on Windows
throws a terminating error. Windows users should keep using the stock
`Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` module and its native
`Connect-SPOService`.

### Supported auth flows

Supported in this release:

- certificate-based app-only auth
- system-browser interactive auth via `-UseSystemBrowser`

Not supported in this release:

- sovereign clouds (`sharepoint.us`, `sharepoint.de`, `sharepoint.cn`): the
  sign-in authority is fixed to the commercial cloud, and `-Url` accepts only
  `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com`
- embedded-webview interactive auth
- username/password auth
- managed identity
- Azure Cloud Shell (no local browser / no reachable loopback listener;
  see the note under [Interactive system browser](#4-interactive-system-browser))

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. The `docs/investigation/` folder is intentionally
preserved so future contributors have the full trace of root-cause
analysis: the IL inspector, the reflection-based bypass, the PnP bridge,
and the `ProcessQuery` direct helper are all there.

For a bug that looks module-specific (e.g. a particular SPO cmdlet still
fails after `Connect-SPOServiceCrossPlatform`), please include:

- exact PowerShell version (`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`)
- SPO module version (`Get-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -ListAvailable | Select Version`)
- full error, ideally with `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` and
  `-ErrorAction Stop`
